    " \n",
    "    You are creating a Python program to simulate a simple guessing game. The game will have the following rules:\n",
    "\t- This program will generate a random number `between 1 and 50` and store it in a variable called `secret_number.` For this, i will need to import randint() from the random library in python. \n",
    "\t- Then user will be given 5 attempts to guess the `secret_number.`\n",
    "\t- This program will use a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for their guess and provide feedback based on their input. (Remember that input() returns a string even if the user enters a number.) \n",
    "\t- Firstly, handled this case where the user enters a `non-numeric` input. For this, i will need to add a try/except block. If the entry is non-numeric, this conversion should fail and python will go to the except block. Under the except block, handle this error by printing `Invalid input! Please enter a valid number` and utilize the continue statement to allow the user to try again without reducing their remaining attempts.\n",
    "\t- If the user guesses the correct number, print `Congratulations! You guessed the secret number `secret_number` correctly!` and break out of the loop.\n",
    "\t- If the user's guess is too high, print `Try again! Your guess is too high. You have `attempts_left` attempts left.` where `attempts_left` is the number of remaining attempts.\n",
    "\t- If the user's guess is too low, print `Try again! Your guess is too low. You have `attempts_left` attempts left.`\n",
    "\t- If the user runs out of attempts, print `Game Over! The secret number was `secret_number. `Better luck next time!` and break out of the loop.\n"
